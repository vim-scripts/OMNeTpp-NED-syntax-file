I didn't find a syntax file for the network description language of the OMNeT++ network simulator. Its files are called *.ned.

This syntax file just does basic highlighting and doesn't know any regions or areas. I will maybe change this when I learned how to do it ;)

If somebody has a better syntax file for this filetype, please tell me!
